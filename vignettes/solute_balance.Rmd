## Overview

This file displays the **solute mass balances** for Calcium, Chloride,
Magnesium, NH3/NH4, Sodium, and Sulfate for WY2019 at each of the Central Sands
study lakes. Mass fluxes are calculated as follows:

  * **P, GWin, GWout:** We multiply the mean monthly concentrations of each 
  solute in precipitation, upgradient groundwater, and the lake by the monthly
  volume of precipitation, groundwater inflow, and groundwater outflow
  (respectively), then sum for an annual total. Measured water chemistry results
  are interpolated to a daily timestep and then averaged for each month.
  * **I - O:** Inflows minus the outflows, i.e., P + GWin - GWout. If there were 
  no biological uptake and no other missing sources/sinks, this would equal the 
  change in solute mass in the lake (i.e. "Delta Lake").
  * **Delta Lake:** Change in solute mass in the lake (current month lake 
  concentration * lake volume minus previous month)

## Using d18O-derived water balance

### Pleasant Lake

**Observations:**

  * **Ca, Cl, Mg, Na:** There appears to be quite a bit of biological 
  uptake/precipitation of these solutes (compare "I-O" to "Delta Lake"). 
  * **SO4:** is strongly affected by a large lake reading in Oct 2018 followed 
  by near-zero concentrations for the rest of the year. If this started one 
  month earlier, "Delta Lake" for SO4 would be near-zero (since Sept 2018 was 
  also near-zero)
  * **NH3/NH4:** This is the only solute where most of the influx comes from 
  precipitation, rather than from groundwater inflow.

```{r psnt2, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8.5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
lake <- "Pleasant"
plot_solutes(mass_fluxes2, lake, text_size)
# kableExtra::kable(format_table(mass_fluxes2, lake), 
#                   caption = sprintf("Percent of Total Inflow: %s Lake", lake))
```

### Long Lake

**Observations:**

  * **Ca, Mg, Na:** As at Pleasant, there appears to be quite a bit of biological 
  uptake/precipitation of these solutes (compare "I-O" to "Delta Lake"). 
  * **Cl:** We appear to be missing a source of Cl to the lake, whether that's 
  coming from a contaminated groundwater source or surface runoff.
  * **SO4:** There is a much smaller biological uptake/precipitation component 
  here than with Ca, Mg, or Na, but it is still noticeable.
  * **NH3/NH4:** Missing a major sink of NH3/NH4 in the lake.

```{r long2, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8.5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
lake <- "Long"
plot_solutes(mass_fluxes2, lake, text_size)
# kableExtra::kable(format_table(mass_fluxes2, lake), 
#                   caption = sprintf("Percent of Total Inflow: %s Lake", lake))
```

### Plainfield Lake

**Observations:**

  * **Ca, Mg, SO4:** As at Pleasant, there appears to be quite a bit of biological 
  uptake/precipitation of these solutes (compare "I-O" to "Delta Lake"). 
  * **Na, Cl:** As at Long Lake (for Cl), we appear to be missing a source of Na 
  and Cl to the lake. A likely explanation is that this comes from road salt 
  from the nearby road.
  * **NH3/NH4:** As at Long Lake, we're also missing a major sink of NH3/NH4 in 
  the lake.

```{r pfl2, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8.5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
lake <- "Plainfield"
plot_solutes(mass_fluxes2, lake, text_size)
# kableExtra::kable(format_table(mass_fluxes2, lake), 
#                   caption = sprintf("Percent of Total Inflow: %s Lake", lake))
```

## Using Mg-derived water balance

The Mg-derived water balance leads to much closer values for "I-O" and "Delta
Lake" for many cations/anions. It matches expectations for Calcium in
particular - Pleasant Lake shows signs of calcification, but neither Long Lake
nor Plainfield Lake do (which matches field observations of marl on vegetation).
However, the Mg-derived water balance is not trustworthy due to many instances
of negative groundwater inflow/outflow. See more detailed explanation in
"water_budget_results.html" and "water_budget_approach_overall.html" for
equations.
